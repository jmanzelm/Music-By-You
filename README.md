# DuckHacks 2017

This repository contains the code for our submission to the DuckHacks 2017 Hackathon hosted by JPMorgan and Google.

## What is it?

Our submission is an emotion-driven music selection program. It uses Microsoft's emotion API to analyze the emotion of a user and play music to match their mood.

## How do I use it?

To use it, there are several dependencies that need to be installed. These include `pygame`, `scikit-learn`, `selenium`, `opencv`, and `chromium`. The program itself can be run by downloading the source and running `driver.py` using Python 2. The current version only works on Mac OSX, but can be adapted to work on Linux with some modifications.
